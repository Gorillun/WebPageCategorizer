 *The program uses Java and JSoup components to scan HTML code from 
 * given URLS. The information is then handed to the appropriate Category class for storing
 * the string and number of times it appears in each URL. The Category is then stored in the
 * Inventory class in an Inventory node that stores strings and the category classes that are 
 * associated with that String. The user is prompted via a GUI which accepts a URL and 
 * returns the appropriate category.
